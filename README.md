### About!
To help my friends in biomedical engineering research on the "Filtering electrocardiographic signals using an unbiased and normalized adaptive noise reduction system" article I extracted data for noise filtering By using the proposed UNANI system in ECG signals can be more effective than LMS filtering as you can see in page 3, with less noise remaining on signal and even can be said that the noise has been removed from UNANR filtering algorithm.

> We put our signal with noise in one of the inputs of Matlab's UNANR Function, which with its output we can correct our signal, but at first, it has an amplitude of 0.25mv amount of initial error, but after 1 second it will become zero.
